### TypeScript based Libraries

- some libraries are only aval for JS and TS doesn't understand JS so, we have to use types for libraries like @types/lodash
- While when there is no types library present we will use declare command. like declare var GLOBAL.

- when getting dat from backend in json format we can use `class-transformer` to convert data in understandable format like `plainToInstance`.
- or we can use `class-validator`
